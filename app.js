It can help you achieve your goals through keeping better track of your intentions and help you stay accountable of your actions. Writing your thoughts down also strengthens your memory and essentially lets your brain know that you want to remember what you wrote down. It also obviously improves your writing and communication skills because you'll consistently be writing down your thoughts and emotions into proper sentences.";
